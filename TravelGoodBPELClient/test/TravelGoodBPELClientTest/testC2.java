        (cancelling fails) Create an itinerary with three bookings and book it. Make sure that the booking
        status is confirmed for each entry. During cancelling of the trip, the cancellation of the second
        booking should fail. Check that the cancelling resulted in an error condition (e.g. value of status
        variable, exception, HTTP status code). Get the itinerary and check that the returned itinerary
        has cancelled as the first and third booking and confirmed for the second booking.
