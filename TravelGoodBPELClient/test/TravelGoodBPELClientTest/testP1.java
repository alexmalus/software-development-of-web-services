        (planning and booking) Plan a trip by rst planning a flight
        (i.e. getting a list of flights and then adding a  flight to the itinerary),
        then by planning a hotel, another flight, a third flight, and finally
        a hotel. Ask for the itinerary and check that it is correct using JUnit's
        assert statements { i.e. assertEquals, assertTrue, . . . { in particular,
        that the booking status for each item is unconfirmed.
        Book the itinerary and ask again for the itinerary. Check that each booking status is now confirmed
